            Hi there, <br>
            <br>
            Signing on new clients can feel like you've won a big prize. I don't know about you, but<br>
            I do a happy dance when we add a new account!

            Bad news: if you don't onboard these clients properly, it's going to hurt your accounts<br>
            and lower your retention rate.
